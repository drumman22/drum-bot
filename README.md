# drum-bot
Spent a few days making this, was using different ways to make this work and I think it came out pretty good.
There aren't many commands but this is mainly used for moderation.

Was maded using python, discord.py library.

# Cresidentials 
go to drum-bot > files > information.py to change the cresidentials to your liking.
